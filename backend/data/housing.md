# Ayobo Area Guide

Ayobo is a high-density suburban district in Lagos State's Alimosho Local Government Area. It is the last town bordering Aiyetoro, Ogun State, and shares the Local Council Development Area with Ipaja. According to the 2006 census, it had a population of approximately 633,009 people. The history of Ayobo can be traced back to the historical movement of Prince Olalore (who happened to be Oduduwa's grandson and a great hunter and fisherman) from Ile-Ife. According to legend, the prince migrated with his immediate family and followers from one settlement to the next, establishing hunting steads and fishing points along the way, until they finally settled at Iga-Aperi, which was a jungle full of cats. As a result, hunters named the settlement Igbo-Ologbo (Forest of Cats). It was not until 1941, following a ruling in favour of the Baale of Igbo-Ologbo on the right of ownership of the land, that the name was changed. According to reports, when the indigenes returned from the court in Lagos, they rejoiced and sang "A-yo-bo-lowo-ota Igbo-Ologbo" (we are liberated from the enemies of Igbo-Ologbo).

# Magodo Area Guide

Magodo is one of Lagos's most treasured possessions. It is situated close to the border between Lagos and Ogun States on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. For a place that is now regarded as one of the best residential areas in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial hub, it was once a sacred land for traditionalists with many taboos. The use of Mortars and Pestles is one of the taboos frowned upon by the residents of this community. This taboo gave rise to the community's name, Magodo (derived from "Ma gun odo," a Yoruba order that translates to "Do not pound in a Mortar"). This reflects the fact that history is never truly forgotten, even if most people do not practise it. Magodo is in the Kosofe Local Government Area and is bounded by Ikosi-Ketu and Ojodu Berger. The community is divided into two phases: Magodo GRA Phase 1, which is located in Isheri, and Magodo Phase 2, which is located in Shangisha. In this guide, you will find out about: It is worth noting that Magodo was originally designed as a Government Residential Area (GRA) for government employees. You can see why it is arguably the most appealing residential area on the Mainland. Magodo is now considered an upscale neighbourhood, with residents from both the middle and upper classes. Living in Magodo gives you access to all of the 'good stuff' in Ikeja, such as business and employment opportunities, a social life that allows you to meet some of the most talented and business-savvy people in Lagos, entertainment and nightlife, and so on. Magodo has long been known as the residence of many Nigerian celebrities who prefer to stay on the Mainland. Olamide Adedeji aka Badoo, the YBNL boss, has been known as the king of the streets for more than a decade and lives up to his street knighthood by refusing to leave the mainland, where he was raised. If you decide to stay in Magodo, you might see him as a neighbour just across the street. Magodo residents have tight security, a reliable power supply, and a well-developed road network. The drainage system is also very good, and the water supply is consistent. A residential area of this calibre would be incomplete without appropriate grocery stores and other household necessities. Apart from being close to the famous Mile 12 market and Ikeja, where the Ikeja City Mall is located, the following are a few places within the community to check for your shopping needs. Magodo Shopping Arcade offers a mall-like experience thanks to the numerous stores housed within its walls.

You may be wondering why an estate in Magodo is called 'Unilag,' despite the fact that it is a long distance away from this Federal School. This is because the estate is owned by the University of Lagos co-operative, and as a result, many of the schools' staff own homes there. Many of the streets are even named after school departments, such as Science Road, Humanities Road, and so on. Regardless of this connection, the estate is open to anyone who wishes to settle there. The sidewalks are nicely paved, and there are many plants in front of the houses. The sale of goods on the street and the production of noise pollution are both prohibited.

At night, the tranquil atmosphere of the Paradox Bar and Grill is enhanced, especially if you choose to relax on the top floor. As you sip your drink and savour those chops, you can get a bird's eye view of the entire expressway stretch. Their Asun is a must-order.

# Tenancy Agreements in Nigeria for Landlords and Tenants – What you need to know

Tenancy Agreements are used worldwide to define the tenancy relationship, and this is also the case in Nigeria. What is a Tenancy Agreement?A Tenancy Agreement is a contract between a Landlord and the Tenant which sets out the rights and obligations of both the Landlord and the Tenant when renting property in Nigeria. A Tenancy Agreement is not mandatory, and the fact that a tenancy agreement does not exist in a tenancy relationship does not mean that the Landlord and Tenant have no rights in the tenancy. Both Landlord and Tenant have something called implied rights in all Tenancy relationships whether or not a Tenancy Agreement exists. However, a Tenancy Agreement is important because it provides further protection for both the Landlord and Tenant, and it expands on the implied rights. If you are a Landlord about to rent out your property, or if you are Tenant about to rent a property, it is advisable that you insist that there is a Tenancy Agreement. Who creates the Tenancy Agreement?In Nigeria, the Tenancy Agreement is in most cases created by the Landlord or their lawyer. As the Landlord is the owner of the property, they set the terms on which they want to rent their property and present this to the Tenant. Nigeria Property Centre has developed a service for Landlords where they can create their own Tenancy Agreement with the use of the NPC Document Service.Rights of the tenantAs the Tenancy Agreement is a contract between two parties – the Landlord and the Tenant, the Tenant has the right to review the terms of the Tenancy Agreement to determine whether or not the Agreement protects his/her interests. Most Tenancy Agreements are straightforward and easy to understand; however, it is advisable where possible to get a lawyer to review the terms and advise on how they affect the Tenant’s current and future rights.What a Tenancy Agreement should containAs a Landlord or a Tenant, you need to ensure that your Tenancy Agreement includes the following terms and information at a minimum:the names and addresses of the Landlord and the Tenantthe address of the propertythe start date and end date of the tenancyhow much the rent will beother applicable amounts including – legal fees, agency fees, security deposits, service charges/fees etc as applicable the obligations of both the Landlord and the Tenantan outline of bills the Tenant is responsible forThe above list is not exhaustive and in fact there are more terms that are frequently included in well-drafted Tenancy Agreements. Before renting a property, it is important that a well-drafted Tenancy Agreement is signed by both parties as it is the most important document in the tenancy relationship.Where to get a Tenancy AgreementIf you are a Landlord or the Agent of a Landlord interested in renting your property in Nigeria, then it is important that you create a Tenancy Agreement before renting out the property. Nigeria Property Centre (NPC) in partnership with Lawpadi.com have created an online Tenancy Agreement service for you to create your own Tenancy Agreement yourself.
