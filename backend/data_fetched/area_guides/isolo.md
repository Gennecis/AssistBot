\# Isolo Area Guide

Isolo is a small but thriving town that falls under the jurisdiction of the Oshodi\-Isolo Local Government Area. According to legend, Akinbaiye, an Awori man from Ile\-Ife, was the man who founded the ancient town. He was a farmer, a warrior, and a hunter who, one day, came across the footprints of an elephant and decided to investigate further. He made the decision to kill the elephant in order to demonstrate to other hunters what a great hunter he was. He, on the other hand, realised that his tools were not sharp enough to cut through the elephant's hide. This necessitated him sharpening his tools on a stone that was nearby the rock. When he was telling others about his experience back home, he referred to the location where he killed the elephant as "Iso Olo," which translates as "the place of grinding stone." Later, he and his family relocated to the area. Oshodi, Mushin, and Ijeshatedo are some of the towns and villages that surround Isolo.
