\# Ebute Metta East Area Guide

The Lagos Mainland Local Government Area includes the suburb of Ebute Metta. Ebute Metta translates to "The Three Harbours" in Yoruba. This was in reference to Iddo, Otto, and Oyingbo, which were historically known as the "Three Harbours" because they were under the sovereignty of the king, who had agents in charge of collecting taxes from ships that used them to transport commodities to Lagos. It is one of the oldest and most recognised neighbourhoods in Lagos. People from the lower and middle classes live and work in this area, which is also the centre of business. The area was thoughtfully planned and built in the 1960s, but because there isn't a maintenance culture, there are certain parts that don't seem extraordinary but are nonetheless decent. Ebute Metta is divided into two sections: east and west. Denton Street is now Murtala Muhammed Way, Griffith Street, Freeman Street, King George V Street is now Herbert Macaulay Street, Cemetery Street, Bola Street, Osholake Street, Tapa Street, and Okobaba Street are all in Ebute Metta West. Then in the east, there's Barclay Street. Moor Road, Abeokuta Street, St. Agnes Street, Church Street, and many others. In this guide, you will find out about: Ebute Metta's history is one of its most fascinating aspects. In 1867, the native Egba Christians in Abeokuta, who were having several misunderstandings with the dominant traditionalists, were afraid that the traditionalists would attack them if the European missionaries left the city. They urged the missionaries to save them and take them to Lagos. With the help of the missionaries, the Egbas were given a portion of land in Lagos, and they built and established a town now known as Ebute Metta. Still, the Ebute Metta Station, also called the Mobolaji Johnson Station, can hold up to 6000 people and is the largest train station in West Africa. In June 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari opened the project for business at the Mobolaji Johnson Railway Station in Ebute Metta. He said that the project was another success in his administration's work to bring the railroad network back to life and make it a good way to move both freight and people. The headquarters of the Nigerian Railway Corporation is also in the same neighbourhood. It's also important to note that Ebute Metta is where the Redeemed Christian Church of God was first built. The church was established in 1952 at Ebute Metta by Rev. Josiah Akindayomi, of blessed memory. The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) is the most popular and wealthiest Pentecostal church in Nigeria. It also holds the largest share of the nation's private property. Development in the neighbourhoods surrounding the church has been facilitated by the church's presence at Ebute Metta. It is noteworthy that the Egba in Ebute Metta formed the first group of Nigerian civil workers because the majority of them went on to work as engineers, technicians, and stationmasters for the Nigerian Railway Corporation.
