\# Ojodu Berger Area Guide

Located between Lagos and Ogun State, Ojodu Berger serves as a gateway. It is part of the Ojodu Local Council Development Area, but it is also in Ogun State, at least in theory. A new LCDA was needed to supplement Lagos State's original 20 local government areas, so the old Ikeja LCDA was reorganised into the Ojodu LCDA. Powerline, Agidingbi (a subset of Agudi), and Ojodu Berger (another subset) make up the entire group. It is bordered by Magodo to the north, Agege to the south, Alausa to the east, and Akute to the west. Omole, Ogba, and Magodo Isheri are all nearby neighbourhoods worth checking out for some local flavour. In this guide, you will find out about: Ojodu Berger is a very busy area that faces the Lagos\-Ibadan Expressway, one of Nigeria's most popular inter\-state routes. Several buses bound for various Nigerian states are housed in the large bus park located beneath the Berger bridge. Buses, cabs, minivans, BRTs, and other modes of transportation are also available to get you around Lagos. Whether you are leaving or entering Lagos, there is bound to be a mode of transportation that works for you. The Ojodu\-Berger pedestrian bridge is also one of the longest in Nigeria. It was commissioned by the former Lagos Governor to alleviate traffic congestion in the region, which served as a major entry point into the state.
