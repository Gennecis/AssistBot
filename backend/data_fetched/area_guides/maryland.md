The Maryland metropolis was founded in 1950 when a group of missionary sisters known as "Our Lady of the Apostle" purchased the land with the intention of establishing a school in the area, now known as the Maryland Comprehensive Secondary School (MCSS). While bidding for the land, a certain sister known as "Rev Mother Arcade" prayed to the Virgin Mary, who is held in high regard among the Catholic faithfuls, and after the purchase was successful, she named the area after her.
